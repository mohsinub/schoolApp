## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with START_HERE.md, not ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Run First** - Get the app working before diving into code
3. **Test the API** - Use Postman or cURL to understand endpoints
4. **Read Code** - Start with StudentList.js, it's the main UI
5. **Ask Questions** - Check documentation before getting stuck
6. **Take Notes** - Write down what you learn
7. **Make Changes** - Modify the code and see what happens
8. **Break It** - Don't be afraid to experiment
